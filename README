YAIbot

Yet Another IRC bot, this IRC bot is based on the well known 
Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable framework, using this framework gives us
fast access to the power of POE within our bot.

YAIbot has some interesting features like:
+ On the fly (un)load of modules
+ Small scripts for small tasks

This is a generalized wrapper of BasicBot::Pluggable created just
for fun!
